# Roblox Hax!

So we have Nya hub (formerly ntg hub), which is basically a script hub i made using wally ui library thingy because i was too tired to search my scripts in the executor and i just made this thing. I want to point out that i didnt make any script you see and all credits go to their official makers.

Nya hub is unfinished and will be heavily updated. You don't have to update anything, just run the script as usual

to use, put this thingy in ur roblox executor:

local ui_number_here = ""
-- 1 = wally (default original look)
-- 2 = soon
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FocaNTG/Robloz-Hax/main/nya-hunb.lua"))()
