# Nya Hub!

Nya hub is unfinished and will be heavily updated. You don't have to update anything, just run the script as usual

# Usage
put this in your executor:
```
local mercury = true

if mercury == true then

  print("mercury1")

       loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FocaNTG/Robloz-Hax/main/ui2.lua"))() 

  elseif mercury == false then

    print("wally1")

    loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FocaNTG/Robloz-Hax/main/ui1.lua"))()

  end
```

set the mercury value to true if you want the new ui, or to false for the original one
