# Nya Hub

The Nya hub is still under construction and will receive substantial updates. No need for you to make any updates; just run the script as usual.

# Usage

Place the following code into your scripting environment & execute it to load the second UI:

```lua
local useMercuryLib = true

loadstring(game:HttpGet(
	useMercuryLib and 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FocaNTG/Robloz-Hax/main/libraries/ui-2.lua' or
	'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FocaNTG/Robloz-Hax/main/libraries/ui-1.lua'))() 
```

---

*You are welcome to change `useMercuryLib` to `false` to use the Wally edition of the UI.*
